### Expense, Sponsorship &amp; Donation Tracking CMS for US K–12 Schools
> Developed a web-based content management system (CMS) to streamline
            the tracking of school-related expenses, sponsorships, and donations
            across U.S. K–12 institutions. Integrated RSS feeds to synchronize
            financial data with external school systems, enabling real-time
            visibility for administrators and stakeholders. The platform
            improved financial transparency, reduced manual reporting, and
            supported fundraising efforts at both district and school levels.
